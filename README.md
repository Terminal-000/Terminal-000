## About
I specialize in **fast diagnosis and resolution of complex technical problems** in software projects that block developers and small teams.  
From **backend system failures** to **frontend performance issues**, I tackle problems most people cannot solve.

I help **developers, businesses, and teams** regain momentum by providing fast, actionable solutions — all paid via crypto.
