## About
I’m an experienced software engineer bringing **modular design principles** and **efficient system architecture** from enterprise software into the game development space.
I build both **.NET backends** for businesses and **reusable UI frameworks** for Godot and Unity developers which are sound reactive using procedural synthesis — focused on performance, scalability, and last but not least Creativity!
